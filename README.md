Live version: https://sc.jenovs.com

I started this project in May 2017 to test my React and Redux skills, but since then it has become a testbed for trying different stuff.

Currently I'm in the process of converting it to Typescript.

### Installation

Clone the repo and run `npm i` and then `npm run start-all`.
